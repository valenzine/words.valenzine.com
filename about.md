My name is Valentin. I dropped the acute accent over the i when I moved abroad.

I lived for 34 years in Argentina —half in Bariloche and then in Buenos Aires— before moving to Torino, Italy. 

I make a living by writing but I rarely write in a *train of thought* fashion. [I stole the code for this blog](https://github.com/Warkanlock/warkanlock.github.io) so I could start doing it. *Choo choo!*
